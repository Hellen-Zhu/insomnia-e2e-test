# Insomnia E2E Test Framework

A comprehensive end-to-end testing framework built with Playwright for testing web applications, specifically designed for Insomnia API client testing.

## Features

- **Fast and Reliable**: Built on Playwright for fast, reliable end-to-end testing
- **Multi-browser Support**: Test across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Rich Reporting**: HTML, JSON, and JUnit test reports
- **Parallel Execution**: Run tests in parallel for faster execution
- **Auto-retry**: Automatic retry for failed tests
- **Visual Debugging**: Screenshots and video recordings on failure
- **Trace Viewer**: Detailed test traces for debugging
- **Page Object Model**: Clean, maintainable test structure
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automated CI/CD with email notifications

## Best Practices

1. **Use Page Object Model**: Organize page interactions into reusable classes
2. **Write Descriptive Tests**: Use clear test names and descriptions
3. **Use Data Attributes**: Prefer `data-testid` over CSS selectors
4. **Handle Async Operations**: Always await page operations
5. **Add Meaningful Assertions**: Test behavior, not implementation
6. **Group Related Tests**: Use test.describe for organizing tests
7. **Use Tags**: Categorize tests with @smoke, @regression, etc.


## Limitations

### Login Test Case Design Approach

Register and Login functionality can be designed from multiple dimensions for test cases. This framework currently implements partial core functionality:

#### Testable Dimensions

1. **UI Interaction Testing**:
   - ✅ Login button visibility and clickability
   - ✅ Form field validation and error messages
   - ✅ Page navigation and redirect functionality
   - ✅ Responsive design and cross-browser compatibility

2. **Functional Flow Testing**:
   - ✅ Login form submission
   - ✅ OAuth redirect validation
   - ❌ Actual authentication flow (limited by security restrictions)
   - ❌ Login state persistence
   - ❌ Logout functionality

3. **Security Testing**:
   - ❌ Password strength validation
   - ❌ CSRF token validation
   - ❌ Session management

4. **Boundary Condition Testing**:
   - ❌ Invalid credentials handling
   - ❌ Network exception handling
   - ❌ Concurrent login restrictions
   - ❌ Account lockout mechanisms

5. **Integration Testing**:
   - ❌ Backend API integration
   - ❌ Database state validation
   - ❌ Third-party service integration

#### Current Implementation Scope

This framework focuses on **UI-level automated testing**, primarily validating:
- Page elements render correctly
- User interactions respond normally
- Navigation flows meet expectations
- Redirect functionality works properly

Due to OAuth security mechanisms and third-party service limitations, complete end-to-end authentication testing cannot be implemented.

### Authentication Testing Limitations

1. **GitHub Login**: 
   - Only validates redirection to respective login interfaces
   - Cannot perform actual authentication due to OAuth limitations and security restrictions
   - Tests focus on UI navigation and redirect functionality

2. **Google Login**: 
   - Validates redirection to Google OAuth interface
   - Cannot perform actual Google authentication due to OAuth 2.0 security restrictions
   - Tests focus on UI navigation and redirect functionality
   - Google's OAuth flow requires user interaction and cannot be fully automated
   - Limited to verifying the login button redirects to correct Google OAuth URL

3. **SSO Login**: 
   - Demo implementation with simplified test cases
   - Limited to basic SSO flow demonstration
   - Not comprehensive for all SSO provider scenarios

4. **Email Verification**: 
   - Cannot test actual email verification due to third-party CAPTCHA and email verification code requirements
   - Limited to UI interaction testing without real email delivery validation
   - Human verification steps cannot be automated

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 22 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Hellen-Zhu/insomnia-e2e-test.git
   cd insomnia-e2e-test
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

## Running Tests

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:ui

# Run tests in specific browser
npm run test:chromium
npm run test:firefox
npm run test:webkit

# Run tests by category
npm run test:smoke
npm run test:regression

# Run tests with specific options
npm run test:workers    # Single worker (serial execution)
npm run test:retries    # 3 retries for failed tests
npm run test:parallel   # 4 workers (parallel execution)

# Run specific test 
npx playwright test example.spec.js 
```

### Code Generation

```bash
# Generate test code interactively
npm run test:codegen

# Generate test code for specific URL
npx playwright codegen https://playwright.dev
```

## Test Reports

After running tests, you can view reports:

```bash
# Open HTML report
npm run test:report

# View test results
npx playwright show-report test-results/
```

## 📝 Writing Tests

### Basic Test Structure

```javascript
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  const title = await page.title();
  expect(title).toContain('Playwright');
});
```

## GitHub Actions CI/CD

### Automated Testing

The project includes GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. **Triggers on**: Push to main, Pull requests, Daily schedule, Manual dispatch
2. **Tests on**: Chromium and Firefox browsers
3. **Uploads**: Test reports and screenshots as artifacts
4. **Sends**: Email notifications for test results

### Manual Workflow Trigger

You can manually trigger the workflow:

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Select "Playwright Tests" workflow
3. Click "Re-run all jobs"
